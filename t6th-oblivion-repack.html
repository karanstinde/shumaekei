                            <p> I already own Oblivion + Shivering Isles. But I'm too lazy to mod myself. Is there a repack with mods bundled in? Preferably those that don't deviate from the lore. Graphics, sounds, UI, some balance tweaks, additional questlines 
There's evidence to suggest that 15-16 series 1 and 16-17 series 1 were printed into oblivion. Part of this is the excessively high population reports for graded cards. Another part of this is the anecdotal evidence with certain players like Rantanen and Tkachuk failing to rise beyond a certain threshold when Rantanen was tearing the league apart and in the running for the Art Ross, and Tkachuk was having a career year on a popular Canadian team. (Both have since slowed down). A third factor. So i downloaded an Oblivion GOTY repack (real long ago, can't exactly remember which repacker it game from but I want to say Darck) and it runs normally until I try to run OBSE, it spits out that unknown Oblivion version. As far as I'm aware it's the latest release and there shouldn't be any reason why it doesn't work. Any help? EDIT: After some toying around I fixed it by replacing the Oblivion.exe with a different one I found online. I've extracted the BSA and run NifOptimizer on Wet and Cold. Would I just repack the optimized folder through 7zip, install and overwrite Wet and Cold? I haven't done intensive modding stuff since Oblivion xD. I'm a little confused at this point, but I know I'm close lol. I'm using Vortex, I feel that's possibly pertinent. Knowledgeable instruction solicited. Cheers. I started this list a year or two ago, and just updated it when new, noteworthy games got uploaded, or removed. -Update: April 19- Added: Settlers III Gold Edition, Heroes of Might and Magic 1+2+3, Titan Quest, Silent Hill 4 The Room Removed: ___________________________________________ Baldur's Gate II: https://archive.org/details/BaldursGate2_Game (4 CD-Rom 2.7GB) 2000 ___________________________________________ Baldur's Gate: https://archive.org/details/Baldurs_Gate_B. Here's my mod and plugin lists: https://modwat.ch/u/Tyler799/modlist I have OCO2's mod and esp loaded last, only followed by Seamless - OCO2's mod and plugin. Yet I'm getting all sorts of problems: https://imgur.com/a/IZ3LD Neckseams, mismatched eyes, face and skin color not matching, dislocated jaws, squited/shut eyes, etc. Very frustrating. Anyone know wtf is going on? ~~EDIT: Solved~~ ~~You can't install Seamless OCO2 "Idiot" edition like the instructions say, as it appears to be broken. I just got a new pc and i've been downloading every game that i've played and wanted to play for a long time and most of them are from Corepack. And i just read that Corepack used to re-encode the audio files and lower the bitrate of the videos. So if anyone downloaded and played some of these games, can you tell me if it's lossless or not? every Assassin's Creed game Borderlands the Pre-Sequel Call of Juarez Gunslinger Crysis 1, Warhead, 3 Dead Space 2 Deus Ex - Human Revolution. 
So I've owned Skyrim for the 360 since it was launched, and played the crap out of it for a long time. I recently decided to ignore all the horrible reviews and resign myself to probably being disappointed by pre-ordering ESO for the Xbox One, which comes out in a couple days. In preparation and to re-immerse myself in TES lore I decided to go back to my old save game and 100% all of the achievements in Skyrim. The only other game I ever did that for was Oblivion, so I figured Click me ( There you go. Requiem, SPERG and SkyRE. All of them working. All of them have 220+ mods installed with. Some of them are unique for some setups. All of them have their mods thoroughly tested and edited to be compatible with each-other. If I count the fluff too the total mod count is 330! This number only represents the base mods. Compatibility patches are excluded because I merged them with their parent mod inside MO whenever I could. And thanks i've looked into this for a few hours around the web, but i'm struggling to find a definitive answer to this. i want to play oblivion on ps3 but i'm annoyed that the 5th yr anniversary edition doesn't have the dlc. so my question is, is it possible to unpack the iso of oblivion on ps3 and then add the dlc to the appropriate directories, repack the iso and burn onto a new game disc in order to run directly little FAQ - q: what is "OLR"? a: OLR is a project lead by hi_flyer that's a true realization of the work represented in koan's gift. it is much closer to the original vision of STALKER than LA. q: how is this different than LA? a: OLR is different than LA because it goes for the original storyline and it's more authentic in the use of cut content - along with creating content from scratch that only existed as images or concept art NOTE: an official English localization If its pretty obvious like for instance what happened with vestigo that a developer is riding on the coattails of other developers even if they are giving them credit then i don't think its fair to users that their tweaks be allowed to stay in the main repositories. Another example is a tweak like iWep where the developer simply refuses to fix age old bugs but they will change the design around and repack it to try and shove it down our throats. Or fix one tweak but let other free tweaks </p>
