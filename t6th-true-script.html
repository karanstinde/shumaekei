Starting yesterday my F1 remap of the default sound device I had for toggling between speakers and headphones now only produces the standard 'help' dialogs that F1 usually brings up. F7 was doing some moving of files highlighted files in explorer and Alt-Shift-t was renaming files based on their location. Now, none of those hotkeys are producing any output. Логическое ИЛИ в классическом программировании работает следующим образом: "если хотя бы один из аргументов true, то возвращает true, иначе – false". В JavaScript, как мы увидим далее, это не совсем так, но для начала рассмотрим только логические значения. Shrek 2 ACT 1 Scene 1 There is a bed onstage behind a silky curtain, backlit. PRINCE CHARMING (os) Once upon a time in a kingdom far, far away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. And throughout the land, everyone was happy. until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there. 
Таким образом, при использовании булевых величин в качестве операндов, оператор возвращает true, если один из операндов true; если же оба false, то возвращает false. Hey. I don't really know what you'd call this, but I have a script which cuts me a load of time and makes my code more readable: ///TrueKey(id,ifBehaviour,isIdeal,thenKey) Host = argument0 Behaviour = argument1 Ideal = argument2 Key = argument3 if Behaviour = Ideal { Host.Key = true } else { Host.Key = false } This is meant to check whether or not an A.I (host)'s behaviour is set to 'Ideal', and if it is, to activate that A.I's action associated with the action.

I was pretty bummed out that they patched the false/true script bug, but I decided to stick with it and go to the Path Of Huln cave every day to see if it triggered the appearance. You know, might as well. It definitely happened sooner than I expected, because after a mere five days of doing that, I got it yesterday. I'm not saying you'll get it after that amount of days of course, but you should definitely make that small effort it takes. Hey all, Having some trouble with a modular controller object I'm trying to make. Basically its step event calls a script and tries to get it to return true or false. It does to by checking the "light" values of all instances of an object (obj_lantern). Except I can't even get that far. The controller object has this as its step event: go = scr_condition_lightcount(1,1); if (go = true) script_execute(scr_success_roomchange(room1)); The error I'm getting is with scr_condition_ligh. 
I have: ltscript type="text/javascript"gt document.onload = document.forms 0 ltlistnamegt.options 'ltoptiongt' selected = true; lt/scriptgt Which does not work. Please advise. I've created a PowerShell script which runs in the background while a Task Sequence is running, providing the overall progress of the sequence on screen. Yes there are a number of these around but this works well and is only 50 lines of code and no package. It was inspired by Damien Van Robaeys's attempts. amp#x200B; I have been trying to create a script that can run without a package so it can be the first step in a bare metal deployment. To use it, use the new PowerShell script function. I feel it's important people know this, so I am posting so users know what they are buying: so, fair warning to those who own a True Blue stick (I don't) but when SwingFlip was working on the ModMyClassic team they did a dump of the USB sold by True Blue and it was discovered that the device installs a "check" for compatible usb devices (theirs) and will shut down if it detects a non-supported device. When it was mentioned in this sub it does I wanted to see for myself. I saw u/ laserwean (https://www.reddit.com/user/laserwean)s post ( Link (https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/8xe4c2/2nd_try_node_realtime_performance_monitor/)) and thought: yeah why not try it myself. Spoiler: I was not able to run it (I'm an idiot). BUT I found a simpler way to do it with docker. # Prerequisites Running Nano Node with RPC enabled ( Tutorial (https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/Docker-node)) Webserver with PHP ( Tutorial (https://www.digitalocean.co. 
Like out of nowhere, they always say it in some weird swarmy way, like it's below them. It's like they assume its just some pop culture show about dragons. The irony is how deep and involved the plot of the show is, and how the characters are woven into each other's stories. It's not like it's like a popular sitcom ending or a big reality TV show. Also a thought about the last episode for anyone who sees this post. I think it was exactly what a lot of us had hoped for from the start. I've seen this question asked a lot across many, many Google searches, but I cannot find an answer that satisfies me. Currently, I have a signup form on my website that sends my customers a coupon. I'd like to add a message that says "Thank you for submitting your email. You will receive your coupon shortly." when they submit their email. I only have a very, very basic understanding of HTML code. amp#x200B; lt!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form --gt ltlink href=" h (//cdn-images.mailchim. I have used DockSTARTer to set up all of my Docker containers (Sonarr/Radarr/TransmissionVPN/LetsEncrypt) and the reverse proxy using nginx inside the LetsEncrypt container works for Sonarr and Radarr but I always receive 502 Bad Gateway when trying to access Transmission. Do I need to setup some sort of bridge network to the LetsEncrypt container to get this to work? I'm assuming it has something to do with the fact that the TransmissionVPN container is the only one running behind EDIT: I fixed it! After several hours of searching, I finally found a relevant github issue for Symfony. When the build process happens, it puts a app.css file in the build folder right by the app.js. All I had to do was include that in my base.html.twig file and it worked as intended! Figured I'd keep this up in case someone else runs into the issue. amp#x200B; Hey guys, amp#x200B; So I'm using Symfony 4 with Vue as the front end. I've been running into a few issues when it comes. Hi everybody, I'm getting the following errors when using npm install on my machine: https://i.imgur.com/D9hGtID.png I tried with npm audit fix but it didn't worked. I'd like to have all the warnings solved. Here is my package.json file: ``` "private": true, "scripts": { "dev": "npm run development", "development": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --progress --hide-modules --config=node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.config.js". So, basically, I am trying to implement a barrier. I have done multithreading before using POSIX and MPI but I can't figure out multithreading in Unity. If I were to implement a barrier application, how would I go on about it? All the tutorials I have looked at consider the same script and not two different/ same scripts executing on two separate objects. I understand that the Update() function is called simultaneously for each GameObject but the Start() function is called sequentially I currently admin a Starbound server on gameservers.com for me and some friends. I had it up and running just fine with user accounts as of earlier today (and it has been running for weeks with those accounts; logging in worked, etc.). My friend asked me to create a new account for a new player. So I hopped on, did nothing to the config but add the new account, and that's when the issue started. I hit "restart server" with the new account made in config, and now every time the server starts. Hi, would appreciate some insight on this issue if anyone has any: amp#x200B; In my main game I have a selection system setup so the player can click different interactable objects and use them. I have two bools set up in the Selection script, isSelected which remains true for every frame that the object is selected for, until it's deselected, and selectStart which should just register true for the first frame it was selected, then change to false on the next frame. Both bools are public.
