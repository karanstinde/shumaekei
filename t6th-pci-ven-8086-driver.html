здравствуйте уважаемые,господа.это мой первый пост на этом форуме,будьте снисходительны пожалуйста.нашёл вас совершенно случайно,прочитав в каком-то блоге что вы существуете(ну EDIT: Rolling back Display Drivers fixes problem. Also, it seems that Napalm WX does a better job at rendering the hi res textures than both the "final" Glide version and Project64 2.0's Glide version. Hi there, so I've been playing Super Smash Bros. on Project 64 1.6 for a couple of years now, and I've been using Glide's Napalm WX as a graphics plugin for hi-res textures for Super Smash Bros. HD. I recently got a Surface Pro and I've been playing with hi-res textures working happily Даты в формате dd. Купил 5 дней назад в конфигурации с core i5 без ОС. Установил Win 7 x64, вроде бы отличный ноут за свои деньги, кроме проблемы описаной больше никаких нареканий нет. I'm using windows server 2012 R2 on a Gigabyte GA-H170N-WIFI motherboard and cannot find any network drivers that'll work. I also tried using the driver package provided by intel but get an error stating that no Intel network adapters are present and the installation exits. https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/21694/Network-Adapter-Driver-for-Windows-Server-2012- Am I just out of luck and the drivers I'm after don't exist. 
When I boot the Precision 3530 I get the wizard error (in PXE) that the driver is not installed (pci ven\_8086ampdev\_15bbampsubsys\_08201028ampREV\_10). I have added all the drivers with that ID that I can find into my device drivers. I have completely regenerated the boot image, I am now at a complete and utter loss on what to do. I have located the driver on intels site here ( https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25016/Intel-Network-Adapter-Driver-for-Windows-10?product=82185. Hi team. On Asus C202 with Windows 10 not working sleep mode. UEFI by 01.04.2019 amp#x200B; Case with "sleep mode" Step 1. Chromebook is off. Open screen and chromebook start load. All ok. Step 2. Work with Windows 10. All ok. Step 3. Close screen and power led not change status. Always on. Chromebook does not enter sleep mode. amp#x200B; Case with "shutdown when close screen" Step 1. Chromebook is off. Open screen and chromebook start load. Hello everyone. We have quite a few computers that have drivers blocking an in place upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I thought I could create a script using devcon.exe and powershell to remove drivers, restart the computer, and finish upgrades. However, I'm seeing errors where removing the driver doesn't seem to work because it's "in use", which makes sense as these are mostly display drivers. amp#x200B; Is there an easier way to do this? Can you see any way to improve my script Title pretty much summarizes it. So a bit of background. amp#x200B; I kind of go through gaming spells--I'll game for awhile on my PC, then get caught up with life that keeps me from playing for awhile, or I'll play a console for awhile. About a week ago, I was using my laptop and all of a sudden it got really really loud. I assumed a fan issue, and took it to a local repair shop to have it looked at. They determined one of the fans had a bearing that went out and needed to be replaced. I'm trying to deploy my Windows 10 Enterprise image on a HP EliteDesk 800 G4 Small Form Factor PC, but when I do I get this error below. A connection to the deployment share could not be made. The following networking device did not have a driver installed. PCI\VEN\_8086ampDEV\_15BBampSUBSYS\_83E2103CampREV\_10 amp#x200B; So far I've tried installing the WinPE enterprise driver pack for Win10 from the link below and imported them as Out of Box Drivers and updated the deployment share. I figured this is a good place to ask this question: amp#x200B; I bought a laptop with really good specs, however it runs painfully slows and it troubles me, since I believe this should not be happening. What I mean by that is that, if I want to open Chrome, this thing can take up to two minutes and sometimes more loading and appears as if it freezes. This will happen everytime I want to open something, look for something in the browser, etc. I have downloaded all drivers. It also happens.

The driver id is the following: PCI\VEN\_8086ampDEV\_A348ampSUBSYS\_9B221462ampREV\_10 I've tried reinstalling drivers, playing around with my graphics card (worked before) and cables in my pc but with no result.

I have a lot of transactions to do and doing it on my phone is a pain. amp#x200B; amp#x200B; I am far from being a network savvy, but here's what I know so far: \- The website is not down or in maintenance. \- I am also unable to access Intel's download center, for some reason. \- The problem only applies to my computer (all other devices can have access to it on my wifi network). \- Switching from Google Chrome to Firefox. # I just bought a new laptop "Dell XPS 15, 9570" Bugs and other problems fixed if you scroll down I'm almost completely satisfied with it but it has one problem or some problems, but the worst is the sound driver automatically install itself. when installing the computer completely clean you see the driver you want = " High definition Audio " but after a while it disappears and replaced with = " Realtek(R) Audio " I do not understand why? the other worked much better Searched the bejeezus out of this, gotta lotta hits, but the only responses either pertain to hosting a server, or link to a tool that has been removed. Basically, after a few moments of play, I get a "Host Not Responding" error accompanied by the expected behavior such a message entails (if rapid day/night cycling can be called "expected"). On p2p servers, it's usually intermittent, followed eventually by a permanent block where I have to go back to the main menu and reconnect, rinse, repeat. I lost audio for my computer. My headphone and mic jacks all have stopped working. USB mics still work. I have tried the top and the front jacks. The playback devices (even the disabled ones) will not show anything I plug in. Realtek HD Audio Driver isnt in the list of Programs or in Control Panel. It is also not in Device Manager (Even after showing hidden devices). Ive attempted to install it countless times from several different sources including from my motherboards official site (https://w. 
Hi, amp#x200B; This is quite appalling, I left my laptop to sleep overnight and was shocked to see that my battery has dropped from 88% to 12%. I have tried powercfg /SleepStudy and came up with the following results: https://imgur.com/a/sZCHGH3 (https://imgur.com/a/sZCHGH3). For the full document please refer to: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XiNCsnPp2zljWkRSm3NHdjMR1LL7rs9m (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XiNCsnPp2zljWkRSm3NHdjMR1LL7rs9m) and use a HTML viewer to look at this. So I just built my computer and I've been having some odd errors. First off, I have a constant Blue Screen that appears whenever I use a screen recording program, most commonly OBS Studio. Any time I close the program the computer crashes and I get the following code: Stop Code: System_Service_Exception What failed: wdf01000.sys I've looked online and tried all the ways to fix the error and nothing works. I've reinstalled the program at least 3 times as well. Tried reregistering Hello all - I have a HP ProDesk 600 G4 MT where we are trying to pull in the appropriate drivers through Microsoft Deployment Toolkit but continuously get the following error: "A connection to the deployment share (\\server\sharename) could not be made. The following networking device did not have a driver installed. PCI\VEN\_8086ampDEV\_15BBampSUBSYS\_83ED103CampREV\_10." amp#x200B; Our process is to download the driver pack from HP, unzip, import into MDT under a folder. 
# I just bought a new laptop "Dell XPS 15, 9570" I'm almost completely satisfied with it but it has one problem or some problems, but the worst is the sound driver automatically install itself. when installing the computer completely clean you see the driver you want = " High definition Audio " but after a while it disappears and replaced with = " Realtek(R) Audio " I do not understand why? the other worked much better and has much better sound and much more settings So I run Windows 10 on an MSI GS63 stealth, and it's worked fine up to this point. I turned on the computer today and there was suddenly no audio output device installed when I clicked on the speaker. I tracked the problem down to device manager, where it showed that the High Definition Audio Controller had a warning sign and wasn't able to start (Code 10). The error message given in the driver details page is: amp#x200B; Device PCI\VEN\_8086ampDEV\_A348ampSUBSYS\_12101462ampREV\_10\. Hi, amp#x200B; I thought I'd post this here because sysadmin sub I got no response. On one machine (HP Elitebook 840 G4) when it gets to the Post Install Application Updates task, it gets stuck on installing an Intel update that was released 23rd November last year and the laptop just keeps rebooting: amp#x200B; The update that's failing is the Intel Corporation System - 9.21.0.3.109 driver which I think is the Conext HD Audio or Intel HD Graphics amp#x200B; These are the errors. Hello everyone! I've bought this laptop yesterday and did a clean W10 install on it. It doesn't have an optical drive so it's only logical that there's no driver CD included. After the Windows install, there were a lot of drivers missing but I was able to get some from the official laptop site: https://www.asus.com/Laptops/ROG-Strix-Hero-II/HelpDesk_Download/ and through the Intel® Driver amp Support Assistant found here: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/intel-driver-suppor. 
Hi, We encounter a problem with network chipset intel I219-LM during Sysprep step. We have this problem only with Dell Optiplex 7060 and 7460 AIO. Problem is that computer not add to Active Directory because have not network at this step (Sysprep). We have test Dell drivers, Intel Drivers, WinPE drivers but not work. What is strange is after Sysprep steps, when logon on Windows 10 network drivers are installed and network works. We use UEFI. We have also test to "legacy option ROMs". </p>
